Agate was formed as a partnership in 1982 by three advertising executives, Amarjeet Grewal, Gordon Anderson and Tim Eng (the name is a combination of their initials). Amarjeet and Gordon had previously worked for one of the UK’s largest and most successful advertising companies in London, but felt frustrated at the lack of control they had over the direction of the campaigns they worked on. As a result, they moved to the West Midlands region of the UK and set up their own business in 1981. Shortly afterwards they were joined by Tim Eng, with whom they had worked on a project in Hong Kong, and Agate was formed.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part8.htm#bookmark16" class="a">In 1987, the three partners formed a UK limited company and between them own all the shares in it. Gordon Anderson is Managing Director, Amarjeet Grewal is Finance Director and Tim Eng is Creative Director. They now employ about 50 staff at their office in the centre of Birmingham (see </a>Fig. A1.1) and a further 100 or so at seven offices around the world. Each of these other offices is set up locally as a company with the shares owned jointly by Agate and the local directors.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="550" height="197" alt="image" src="Image_027.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark16">Figure A1.1 </a><span class="s21">Staff at Agate Ltd UK office.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Initially the company concentrated on work for the UK motor industry, which has declined in scale in recent years (although much of what remains is still located in the West Midlands region). However, as the company has expanded and internationalized, the type of work it takes on has changed and it now has clients across a wide range of manufacturing and service industries.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">The company strategy is to continue to grow slowly and to develop an international market. The directors would like to obtain business from more large multinational companies. They feel</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">that they can offer a high standard of service in designing advertising campaigns that have a global theme but are localized for different markets around the world.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">The company’s information systems strategy has a focus on developing systems that can support this international business. Not long ago, the directors decided to invest in hardware and software to support digital video editing. This saved money on subcontracting the video- editing work, and with cheap broadband access they have the capability for fast file-transfer of digital video between offices. Now they are considering whether the company should also install its own video streaming servers for use in the growing market for online advertising.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="303" height="26" alt="image" src="Image_028.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: left;"><a href="part4.htm#bookmark4" class="s19">A1.2  </a><h3 href="#bookmark4">Existing Computer Systems</h3></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: left;"><a href="part4.htm#bookmark4" class="s19">A1.2  </a><h3 href="#bookmark4">Existing Computer Systems</h3></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: left;"><a href="part4.htm#bookmark4" class="s19">A1.2  </a><h3 href="#bookmark4">Existing Computer Systems</h3></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark17">Agate already uses computers extensively. Like most companies in the world of design and creativity, Agate uses Apple Macintosh computers for its graphic designers and other design- oriented staff. The secretaries and personal assistants also use Apple Macs. However, the company also uses PCs to run accounts software in Microsoft Windows. Despite all this, Agate has been slow to install computer systems that support other business processes, such as tracking clients and managing campaigns. Last year, Agate had a basic business system for the UK office developed in Delphi for Windows. However, after the system was developed, the directors of Agate decided that it should have a system developed in Java, the object-oriented language originated by Sun Microsystems Inc. One of the reasons for the choice of Java was that it is portable across different hardware platforms and the company wants software that could run both on the PCs and on the Macs. Unfortunately, the person who developed the Delphi software for the company (and was going to rewrite it in Java) was headhunted by an American software house, because of her skills in Java, and has moved to the USA. Fortunately, this developer, Mandy Botnick, was methodical in her work and has left Agate with some object-oriented system documentation for the system she designed and developed.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">This existing system is limited in its scope: it only covers core business information</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">requirements within Agate. It was intended that it would be extended to cover most of Agate’s activities and to deal with the international way in which the business operates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="422" height="25" alt="image" src="Image_029.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: left;"><a href="part4.htm#bookmark4" class="s19">A1.3  </a><a href="part4.htm#bookmark4" class="h3">Business Activities in the Current </a><h3 href="#bookmark4">System</h3></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: left;"><a href="part4.htm#bookmark4" class="s19">A1.3  </a><a href="part4.htm#bookmark4" class="h3">Business Activities in the Current </a><h3 href="#bookmark4">System</h3></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: left;"><a href="part4.htm#bookmark4" class="s19">A1.3  </a><a href="part4.htm#bookmark4" class="h3">Business Activities in the Current </a><h3 href="#bookmark4">System</h3></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark18">Agate deals with other companies that it calls clients. A record is kept of each client company, and each client company has one person who is the main contact person within that company. His or her name and contact details are kept in the client record. Similarly, Agate nominates a member of staff—a director, an account manager or a member of the creative team—to be the contact for each client.</a><a name="bookmark19">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Clients have advertising campaigns, and a record is kept of every campaign. One member of Agate’s staff, again either a director or an account manager, manages each campaign. Other staff may work on a campaign and Agate operates a project-based management structure, which means that staff may be working on more than one project at a time. For each project they work on, they are answerable to the manager of that project, who may or may not be their own line manager.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">When a campaign starts, the manager responsible estimates the likely cost of the campaign, and agrees it with the client. A finish date may be set for a campaign at any time, and may be changed. When the campaign is completed, an actual completion date and the actual cost are recorded. When the client pays, the payment date is recorded. Each campaign includes one or more adverts. Adverts can be one of several types:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_030.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_031.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: left;">newspaper advert—including written copy, graphics and photographs magazine advert—including written copy, graphics and photographs</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_032.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_033.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: left;">Internet advert—including written copy, graphics, photographs and animations TV advert—using video, library film, actors, voice-overs, music etc.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_034.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_035.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: left;">radio advert—using audio, actors, voice-overs, music etc. poster advert—using graphics, photographs, actors</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_036.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">leaflet—including written copy, graphics and photographs.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Purchasing assistants are responsible for buying space in newspapers and magazines, space on advertising hoardings, and TV  or radio air-time. The actual cost of a campaign is calculated from a range of information. This includes:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_037.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_038.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: left;">cost of staff time for graphics, copy-writing etc. cost of studio time and actors</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_039.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">cost of copyright material—photographs, music, library film</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_040.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_041.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: left;">cost of space in newspapers, air-time and advertising hoardings Agate’s margin on services and products bought in.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This information is held in a paper-based filing system, but the total estimated cost and the final actual cost of a campaign are held on the new computer system.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">The new system also holds the salary grades and pay rates for the staff, so that the cost of staff time on projects can be calculated from the timesheets that they fill out.
