They understand that to get a computer to perform the kind of complex tasks involved in running a business, someone has to write a series of instructions that specify precisely what the computer should do. These instructions, written in programming languages such as C++, Java or C# , form what we are all familiar with as computer software.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">However, fewer people are aware of the work that has to be done before the programmer can start writing the program code. The programmer cannot simply make up the rules that guide the operation of the business or guess at the kind of data that needs to be entered into the system, stored and later accessed to provide users with information on-screen or in reports. It is the work of the systems analyst to investigate the way the business works, to understand and document the existing system, whether it is manual or already computerized, and to record the type of data values the business needs to operate and the rules that determine how that data will be processed.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">The <i>systems analyst </i>produces a specification of what the new system must do. This specification will define in clear and unambiguous terms most of the following aspects of the system:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_011.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_012.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_013.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: left;">the characteristics of the data that needs to be held in the system; the rules to be used to ensure that the data that is entered is correct; the rules that describe how the data is to be processed;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_014.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">the layout and content of windows for data entry, enquiries and reports;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_015.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: left;">the rules that ensure that only those people who are entitled to access the data can do so;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_016.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: left;">expectations about the performance of the system, for example how much data it must handle and how quickly it must process requests for information.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark11">Some of the early part of this work may be done by a specialist </a><i>business analyst</i>, whose expertise lies in understanding the way the organization wants the system to work and documenting those requirements in a way that the systems analyst can use. We include the work of the business analyst in the more general term systems analysis.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Given such a specification it is possible to build a computer system, but there are many ways that it could be built. If you give an engineer a specification that states the need for a</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">river crossing, he or she can choose to build a ferry system, a tunnel or a bridge. If a bridge is the solution, there are many possible ways of supporting the roadway. The engineer designing the bridge can choose whether to make it a suspension bridge, how many pillars to use to support the roadway, how many lanes wide the roadway should be, whether to include a cycle path and footway. There are hundreds of design decisions to be made, from the very large scale down to the detailed design of hand rails for pedestrian users.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">The <i>systems designer </i>performs a similar role in designing a new computerized information system. Given a specification of <b>what </b>the system must do, there will be many different possibilities for <b>how </b>the system will perform the required processes. The role of the system designer is to choose from that wide range of possibilities the design that will best meet the needs of the users and other people with an interest in the success of the system, such as the management of the organization where it will be used. In choosing that optimal design, the system designer will take into account not only the specification of what the system must do, but also all the expectations about how much data the system can handle, how fast it must respond, and so on.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Based on the specification produced by the systems analyst, the system designer produces a specification of how the new system will work. This specification will define in clear and unambiguous terms most of the following aspects of the system:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_017.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">how the system as a whole will be organized into modules and subsystems, how these will interact with each other and how they will be allocated to different processors and computers;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_018.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">the programming languages and ready-made software components that will be used to construct the software;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_019.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">in an object-oriented system, the specification of the classes that will deliver the system’s functionality and hold its data when programs are running;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_020.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">the structures in the database where data will be stored and the characteristics of the data that needs to be held in the system;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_021.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">the detailed logic of the algorithms that will operate upon the data and meet the performance requirements of the system;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_022.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">the physical look and feel of the windows for data entry, enquiries and reports, including their colour schemes, fonts and the exact kinds of interface ‘widgets’ to be used—text boxes, radio buttons, etc.;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_023.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">the way in which a security subsystem will control access to the system;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_024.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">how the system will meet requirements for volumes of data and the rate at which that data can be processed and the users’ requests can be responded to.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">It is this design that the programmer then takes and converts into program code that will become the working information system.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part9.htm#bookmark138" class="a" name="bookmark12">Choosing to use an object-oriented programming language (see Chapter </a>4 for an explanation of object-orientation) is one of the decisions that has to be made early on in a project to develop a new system, and, if an object-oriented language is to be used, then it makes sense to carry out the analysis and design in a way that will easily translate into object- oriented program code.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">The Unified Modelling Language (UML) is a way of documenting the outputs from the analysis and design activities in a way that makes it easy for the programmer to translate the design into code. UML is a standard notation for the models that are produced to document the analysis and design. Having a standard notation makes it easier to communicate between different teams.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Of course in the real world nothing is as clear cut as we have described above. You will find people with job titles like analyst/programmer, who talk to the users, analyse and document their requirements, design the solution and write the code. In some projects, management will want all the analysis completed before the design can begin. In others, as soon as a critical mass of analysis material is available, the designers will get to work, and the programmers may even begin producing initial versions of the software while the requirements are still being defined.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part9.htm#bookmark75" class="a">As you will read in Chapter </a>2, which describes some of the challenges that occur when developing information systems, this is not an easy process. There are many views on how to increase the likelihood that an organization going through the process of having a new system developed will get what it wants. Some see it as an engineering problem, arguing that the development of systems should be made more like the engineering of products such as bridges, cars or aircraft. Others argue that it is the human elements of systems (the people that use them) that make the job of developing systems so challenging, and systems analysis and design should take the socio-technical context of systems into account more than it does. Both views have some merit.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">In this book, we explain what a system is and outline the challenges of developing information systems and some of the ways that people have proposed for addressing those challenges. We then work through the lifecycle of developing a system, from the business analysis to the design, and finish by explaining some of the points to be addressed in implementation and some methods that have been proposed for organizing this process.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part9.htm#bookmark34" class="a">Real information systems exist in businesses and other organizations in the real world. To illustrate the development of real systems we use case studies of two companies—one for examples in the book and the other for exercises for the reader. After introducing the two case studies we begin in Chapter </a>1 with an explanation of the theory of systems using some practical examples that should be familiar.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="550" height="206" alt="image" src="Image_025.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part5.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Simon%20Bennett%2C%20Ray%20Farmer%20-%20Object-Oriented%20Systems%20Analysis%20and%20Design%20Using%20UML%20%282010%2C%20McGraw-Hill%20Education%29%20-%20libgen.li.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part7.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
