Now object-oriented approaches are widely used and taught. Back in 1997 we wanted a book to support our teaching, one that put the analysis and design activities in the context of the whole systems life cycle, and that included generic analysis and design issues, such as fact finding. Most books on object-oriented approaches to analysis and design concentrated on object-orientation and on the notation. We also wanted a textbook that used a consistent case study throughout.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">When McGraw-Hill offered us the opportunity to write our own book, these two ideas influenced the structure and content of the book that we put together. This is now the fourth edition of the book.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Since the publication of the first edition in 1999, many things have changed. Two of us left De Montfort University, though one has now returned in a non-academic role, having used UML and trained people in UML over the last ten years in three different jobs in industry. As well as our careers, our ideas have developed, helped in large part by all the feedback and reviews that we have received. UML itself has also changed, with the introduction of V ersion 2.0, which prompted the third edition, and has also become more widely accepted as the common language for systems modelling. But we still believe in the value for teaching and learning of basing the book around a consistent thread of case study material, and have therefore retained this approach in this new edition.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Who Should Read this Book?</h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The three authors of this book believe that systems analysis and design are activities that should take place in the context of the organizations that will use the information systems that are the result. The examples we use are based on business organizations, but they could be any kind of organization in the public or voluntary (not-for-profit) sectors, and the approach we adopt is suitable for most kinds of information system including real-time systems. The book starts with three chapters that set the development of information systems in this context.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">We expect most of our readers to be students undertaking a Diploma, Bachelor’s or Master’s course in a computing or information systems subject. It will also be of relevance to some students of other subjects, such as business studies, who want to understand how business information systems are developed without wanting to be programmers, analysts or designers.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">The book is also suitable for professionals in computing and information systems, many of whom began their professional career before the advent of object-oriented development techniques and who want to upgrade their skills by learning about object-oriented analysis and design. We have used the Unified Modelling Language (UML), which is the de facto standard notation for object-oriented development.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Case Studies</h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In our teaching and training we use case studies as the basis of tutorials and practical work. We also use the same case studies to provide examples in taught material and in student assessments. We believe that it is important that students see analysis and design as a coherent process that goes from initial fact-finding through to implementation, and not as a series of disjointed exercises. This book uses two practical case studies. The first of these, Agate Ltd, is an advertising company. Agate is used for examples in most of the chapters of</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">the book that explain techniques and for some exercises. The second case study, FoodCo Ltd, is a grower of fruit and vegetables and a manufacturer of packaged foods. FoodCo is used for most of the exercises that are included in chapters for the reader to complete.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part8.htm#bookmark14" class="a">The two case studies are introduced in short chapters (</a><a href="part9.htm#bookmark22" class="a">A1 and </a><a href="part16.htm#bookmark270" class="a">B1) that can be found after the Introduction. In these first two case study chapters, we provide background material about the two companies and explain some of their requirements for computerized information systems. Chapter </a><a href="part9.htm#bookmark222" class="a">A2 (between Chapters </a><a href="part16.htm#bookmark291" class="a">6 and </a><a href="part18.htm#bookmark361" class="a">7) presents examples of the requirements model, while </a><a href="part16.htm#bookmark291" class="a">Chapter A3 (between </a><a href="part18.htm#bookmark378" class="a">Chapters 7 and </a><a href="part23.htm#bookmark578" class="a">8) brings together some examples from the first version of the analysis model for Agate’s new system. Chapter </a><a href="part18.htm#bookmark525" class="a">A4 (between Chapters </a><a href="part23.htm#bookmark595" class="a">11 and </a><a href="part31.htm#bookmark931" class="a">12) presents examples from the analysis model after it has been further developed. Chapter </a><a href="part23.htm#bookmark868" class="a">A5 (between Chapters </a><a href="part31.htm#bookmark964" class="a">18 and </a>19) brings together some examples from the design model for the new system. We do not provide models for the FoodCo case study, but FoodCo forms the basis of most of the practical exercises at the end of chapters. A few partial solutions are provided where they are required as the basis for later exercises.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">If you are using this book as a teacher, you are welcome to use these materials and to develop them further as the basis of practical exercises and assessments. Some exercises that you may want to use are provided in each chapter. Further models, solutions and case studies are provided on the book’s website, and this will continue to develop over time.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Exercises for Readers</h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Each chapter contains two kinds of exercises for readers. First we provide Review Q uestions. The aim of these is to allow you to check that you have understood the material in the chapter that you have just read. Most of these Review Q uestions should only take a few minutes at most to complete. Solutions to some of these questions are to be found at the back of the book. The answers to many of them are to be found in the text. Some require you to apply the techniques you have learned, and the answers to these are not always provided.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">At the end of each chapter are Case Study Work, Exercises and Projects. These are exercises that will take longer to complete. Some are suitable to be used as tutorial exercises or homework, some could be used as assignments, and some are longer projects that could be developed over a matter of weeks. We have provided answer pointers to some of these exercises to help you.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.mcgraw-hill.co.uk/textbooks/bennett" class="a" target="_blank">Solutions to more of these exercises are available via the book’s website to bona fide university and college teachers who adopt the book as the set text for their courses. Please visit </a>www.mcgraw-hill.co.uk/textbooks/bennett for details of the support materials.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Structure of the Book</h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Although we have not formally divided the book into sections, there are four parts to the book, each of which has a different focus.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Part 1</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part9.htm#bookmark34" class="a">The new Introduction explains the roles of systems analysts and designers. Chapters </a><a href="part9.htm#bookmark138" class="a">1 to 4 provide the background to information systems analysis and design and to object-orientation. In the first three of these chapters we explain why analysis and design are important in the development of computerized systems and introduce fundamental concepts such as those of systems theory. Chapter </a>4 introduces some of the ideas of object-orientation that will be developed in the second part.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Part 2</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part9.htm#bookmark171" class="a">The second part of the book includes </a><a href="part18.htm#bookmark525" class="a">Chapters 5 to </a><a href="part9.htm#bookmark171" class="a">11. The focus of this part of the book is on the activities of requirements gathering and systems analysis and the basic notation of the Unified Modelling Language (UML). In it we introduce use cases, class diagrams, sequence diagrams, communication diagrams, activity diagrams, state-chart diagrams and the Object Constraint Language (OCL). Chapter 5, which was added for the second edition, discusses models and diagrams and presents one of the UML diagramming techniques—activity diagrams—as an example. In Chapter </a><a href="part16.htm#bookmark270" class="a">5 we also provide an overview of the way the UML techniques fit together in the iterative development lifecycle. This part includes three case study chapters </a><a href="part18.htm#bookmark361" class="a">(A2, </a><a href="part23.htm#bookmark578" class="a">A3 and </a>A4), which illustrate the development of the UML models as the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">analysis activities progress. The purpose of the case study chapters in the book is to show how the models develop as the analysis and design progress. We do not have the space in the book to provide all the analysis and design documentation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Part 3</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part23.htm#bookmark595" class="a">The third part of the book is about system design. It includes </a><a href="part23.htm#bookmark868" class="a">Chapters 12 to </a><a href="part31.htm#bookmark931" class="a">18 and concludes with examples from the design model for the Agate case study (Chapter </a><a href="part23.htm#bookmark595" class="a">A5). In this part we develop the use of most of the diagramming techniques introduced in Part 2. We do this by enhancing the analysis models that we have produced to take design decisions into account. This part covers system architecture, system design, design patterns, and the design of objects, user interfaces and data storage. The design model at the end of this part serves the same purpose as the one at the end of the analysis chapters. Some of the material about architecture that was in </a>Chapter 12 in the third edition has moved to the book’s website.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Part 4</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In the final part we cover the implementation of systems and the issues of how the systems lifecycle is organised and how reusable components can be developed. The chapter on implementation introduces the last of the UML diagram types, component diagrams and deployment diagrams. The chapter on project management that was in the first and second editions is available on the book’s website as part of an attempt to keep the page count, and hence the price, at a reasonable level.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Pathways through the Book</h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Whatever the formal structure of the book, you the reader are welcome to work through it in whatever order you like. However, the book has been written to be read sequentially and not used as a reference, as one critical reviewer pointed out on Amazon. One of the authors has written another book on UML, also published by McGraw-Hill, that can more easily be used as a reference book.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">We have taught several analysis and design modules at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels. These include a first-year module on analysis and design, with the emphasis on the lifecycle and on analysis; and a second-year module with an emphasis on design and the use of methodologies. We would expect to cover the following chapters in each module.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part9.htm#bookmark34" class="a">Analysis module—</a><a href="part9.htm#bookmark75" class="a">Chapters 1, </a><a href="part9.htm#bookmark102" class="a">2, </a><a href="part9.htm#bookmark138" class="a">3, </a><a href="part9.htm#bookmark171" class="a">4, </a><a href="part9.htm#bookmark222" class="a">5, </a><a href="part16.htm#bookmark291" class="a">6, </a><a href="part18.htm#bookmark378" class="a">7, </a><a href="part18.htm#bookmark418" class="a">8, </a><a href="part18.htm#bookmark492" class="a">9, </a>10. (State—chart diagrams are omitted from this so that students are not overloaded with different diagramming notations in the first year.)</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part18.htm#bookmark525" class="a">Design module—Chapters </a><a href="part23.htm#bookmark595" class="a">11, </a><a href="part23.htm#bookmark611" class="a">12, </a><a href="part23.htm#bookmark681" class="a">13, </a><a href="part23.htm#bookmark738" class="a">14 </a><a href="part23.htm#bookmark777" class="a">15, </a><a href="part23.htm#bookmark814" class="a">16, </a><a href="part23.htm#bookmark868" class="a">17, </a><a href="part31.htm#bookmark964" class="a">18, </a><a href="part31.htm#bookmark1004" class="a">19, </a><a href="part31.htm#bookmark1041" class="a">20, </a>21, 22 (available from the book website).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">We have tried to group together techniques under the general headings of analysis and design, even though many of them are used throughout the lifecycle. This does not mean that we necessarily advocate following a lifecycle model that treats analysis and design as separate phases. We suggest an iterative lifecycle in which the models of the system are progressively elaborated and in which analysis and design are interwoven. However, we do believe that analysis and design are separate activities, even if they are not separate stages in a project’s lifecycle. We also think that it is easier to learn analysis and design as separate activities rather than merged together.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part9.htm#bookmark171" class="a">If you plan to use this book for a course that concentrates on UML, then you may want to use the following path through the book—Chapters </a><a href="part9.htm#bookmark222" class="a">5, </a><a href="part16.htm#bookmark291" class="a">6, </a><a href="part18.htm#bookmark378" class="a">7, </a><a href="part18.htm#bookmark418" class="a">8, </a><a href="part18.htm#bookmark492" class="a">9, </a><a href="part18.htm#bookmark525" class="a">10, </a><a href="part23.htm#bookmark814" class="a">11, </a><a href="part23.htm#bookmark868" class="a">17, </a><a href="part31.htm#bookmark964" class="a">18, </a>19, and including the case study chapters. The other chapters can be read as background.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part9.htm#bookmark171" class="a">If you are familiar with the general aspects of information systems development and of object-orientation, and are reading this book in order to gain an understanding of how you can use UML in analysis and design, then you can start with the Introduction and case study chapters, and then go to Chapter </a><a href="part9.htm#bookmark138" class="a">5. If you are not familiar with object-oriented approaches, then you should also include </a>Chapter 4.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Transferable Skills</h4><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Some of the skills of the systems analyst and designer can be classified as transferable or professional skills. Most employers place a high value on these skills. Many colleges and universities provide special modules on these skills, embed them in other modules or provide self-study packages for students. We have included material on fact-finding skills, particularly interviewing and questionnaire design, within the text of the book. We have not included other skills explicitly, but there are opportunities for teachers to use the exercises to develop skills in problem solving, group work, research, report writing and oral presentation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Website and Support M aterials</h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.mcgraw-hill.co.uk/textbooks/bennett/" class="a" target="_blank">This book is supported by materials that we have placed on the book’s website. The website is accessible at </a>www.mcgraw-hill.co.uk/textbooks/bennett/. The website material has been revised for the fourth edition. It includes self-test exercises for students. Materials for lecturers also include Microsoft PowerPoint slides to accompany each chapter, solutions to some of the exercises and copies of the figures from the book that can be used for teaching. If you use these resources in your teaching materials, we ask that you acknowledge our copyright on the material. With every new edition, reviewers ask us to include more, but rarely agree on what to add or what can be taken out. With this in mind, we have added new short sections to the website that supplement some of the chapters in the book.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="mailto:authors@OOADtext.info" class="a" target="_blank">We welcome feedback about the book. Some of the changes that we have made in writing the third and fourth editions have been based on feedback from lecturers and students around the world who have used our book.

All chapters have been revised and updated to reflect developments in the worlds of object-oriented analysis and design and information systems development, the evolution of UML and changes in our own thinking. Chapters </a><a href="part23.htm#bookmark611" class="a">12, </a><a href="part23.htm#bookmark681" class="a">13 and </a>14 have been reorganized to reinstate a chapter on the difference between analysis and design. A summary of changes is available on the website. This is provided for lecturers who need to revise their teaching materials.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Notation</h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We have used certain notational conventions in the book. New terms are shown in <i>italics </i>at the point where they are introduced and explained. Terms from the case study and code examples are shown in Courier font. Where we explain UML notation we use a variant of the Backus- Naur Form (BNF) that is close to that used in the UML Specification itself. Notation definitions are in italics to distinguish them from examples.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">All names of special UML terms are enclosed between angle brackets (e.g., <i>&lt; message-name&gt; </i>). All keywords, strings, etc. are enclosed between single quotes (e.g., <i>‘ loop’ </i>or <i>‘ [ ’</i>).</p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Rules that define a special UML term are signified with <i>:: </i>= between the term and its definition. Repetition of an item is signified by an asterisk placed after that item: <i>* </i>.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Alternative choices are separated by the | symbol (e.g., <i>&lt; alternative-A&gt; </i>| <i>&lt; alternative-B&gt; </i>). Items that are optional are enclosed in square brackets (e.g., [<i>&lt; item-x&gt; </i>]).</p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Where items need to be grouped they are enclosed in simple parenthesis; for example: (<i>&lt; item-1&gt; </i>| <i>&lt; item-2&gt; </i>) <i>*</i></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">signifies a sequence of one or more items, each of which is <i>&lt; item-1&gt; </i>or <i>&lt; item-2&gt; </i>.</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">Simon Bennett, Steve McRobb, Ray Farmer</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">February 2010</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="550" height="114" alt="image" src="Image_007.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part4.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Simon%20Bennett%2C%20Ray%20Farmer%20-%20Object-Oriented%20Systems%20Analysis%20and%20Design%20Using%20UML%20%282010%2C%20McGraw-Hill%20Education%29%20-%20libgen.li.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part6.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
